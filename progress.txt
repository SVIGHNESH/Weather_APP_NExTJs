# Progress Log

## Status
US-001 completed. Weather backend with multi-provider fallback is functional.

## Learnings
- Open-Meteo is used as the primary provider (free, no API key needed)
- Fallback chain: Open-Meteo → OpenWeatherMap → WeatherAPI
- 10-minute cache using in-memory Map to reduce API calls
- All providers map to unified WeatherResponse format
- Express server returns 503 on complete failure
- TypeScript strict mode is enforced

---

## Iteration 1 - Set up multi-provider weather backend
- Implemented three weather provider clients (Open-Meteo, OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI)
- Created unified WeatherResponse type that all providers map to
- Built CacheManager with 10-minute TTL for responses
- Created WeatherService with fallback chain logic
- Set up Express server with GET /api/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon} endpoint
- Error handling returns 503 when all providers fail
- Files created: src/types/weather.ts, src/services/{openMeteoClient,openWeatherMapClient,weatherApiClient,weatherService}.ts, src/utils/cache.ts, src/server.ts, tsconfig.json
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - All three provider APIs have different response formats that need mapping
  - CacheManager uses coordinates rounded to 2 decimal places as cache key
  - Open-Meteo provides WMO weather codes that are mapped to descriptions
  - Error handling logs warnings for each failed provider before throwing 503
