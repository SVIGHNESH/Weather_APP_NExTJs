# Progress Log

## Status
US-001, US-002, US-003, and US-004 completed. Backend API and current weather display component are ready.

## Learnings
- Open-Meteo is used as the primary provider (free, no API key needed)
- Fallback chain: Open-Meteo → OpenWeatherMap → WeatherAPI
- 10-minute cache using in-memory Map to reduce API calls
- All providers map to unified WeatherResponse format
- Express server returns 503 on complete failure
- TypeScript strict mode is enforced
- Prisma v7 requires connection URL in prisma.config.ts, not schema.prisma
- SQLite is suitable for development; use PostgreSQL in production
- Indices created on userId, isFavorite, lastAccessedAt for Location table
- When using generated Prisma client from src/generated/prisma/client, use (PrismaClient as any)({}) for instantiation
- JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- Route parameters from Express can be strings or string arrays; normalize them with Array.isArray() check
- Next.js 16+ is initialized with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- React hooks like useEffect can trigger re-renders; useWeather hook fetches weather data on lat/lon changes
- Tailwind CSS provides utility classes for responsive design (md:, lg: prefixes)
- Component props should use TypeScript interfaces for type safety

## Iteration 1 - Set up multi-provider weather backend
- Implemented three weather provider clients (Open-Meteo, OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI)
- Created unified WeatherResponse type that all providers map to
- Built CacheManager with 10-minute TTL for responses
- Created WeatherService with fallback chain logic
- Set up Express server with GET /api/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon} endpoint
- Error handling returns 503 when all providers fail
- Files created: src/types/weather.ts, src/services/{openMeteoClient,openWeatherMapClient,weatherApiClient,weatherService}.ts, src/utils/cache.ts, src/server.ts, tsconfig.json
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - All three provider APIs have different response formats that need mapping
  - CacheManager uses coordinates rounded to 2 decimal places as cache key
  - Open-Meteo provides WMO weather codes that are mapped to descriptions
  - Error handling logs warnings for each failed provider before throwing 503

## Iteration 2 - Create database schema for locations and favorites
- Installed Prisma and PostgreSQL/SQLite support
- Created User model with email and password fields
- Created Location model linked to User with indices on userId, isFavorite, lastAccessedAt
- Created LocationHistory model for tracking location access patterns
- Ran migrations successfully
- Database schema includes proper foreign key constraints with CASCADE delete
- Files created: prisma/schema.prisma, prisma.config.ts, .env, prisma/migrations/
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Prisma v7 moved database URL from schema.prisma to prisma.config.ts
  - SQLite is good for development; production should use PostgreSQL
  - Using CUID for IDs instead of UUID for better performance
  - Location history table tracks every access for analytics

## Iteration 3 - Build authentication and location management API endpoints
- Installed JWT (jsonwebtoken) and bcrypt (bcryptjs) dependencies
- Created auth middleware to validate JWT tokens from Authorization header
- Created POST /api/auth/register endpoint with password hashing using bcryptjs
- Created POST /api/auth/login endpoint with password validation
- Created POST /api/locations endpoint for creating new locations
- Created GET /api/locations endpoint returning user's locations ordered by most recent access
- Created DELETE /api/locations/{id} endpoint for removing locations
- Created PATCH /api/locations/{id} endpoint for toggling favorite flag
- All endpoints require valid JWT authentication token
- Integrated Prisma generated client for database queries
- Files created: src/middleware/auth.ts, src/routes/auth.ts, src/routes/locations.ts
- Modified: src/server.ts to register auth and locations routes
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Generated Prisma client must be imported from ../generated/prisma/client and instantiated as (PrismaClient as any)({})
  - All errors are caught and return 500 status with generic error message to avoid leaking sensitive info
  - JWT secret can be configured via JWT_SECRET environment variable
  - Express route params with (/:id) can be strings or arrays depending on request; normalize them
  - Created PrismaClient instance per route file (could be optimized as singleton in production)

## Iteration 5 - Build hourly forecast component with interactive timeline
- Created HourlyForecast React component with horizontal scrollable list
- Implemented time, temperature, condition icon, and precipitation % display for each hour
- Added current hour highlighting with gradient background and ring styling
- Created 24/48-hour mode toggle buttons for switching forecast length
- Implemented click/tap functionality to show detailed info for selected hour
- Detailed info panel shows time, temperature, precipitation, and condition description
- Added smooth animations and responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Automatic current hour detection based on system time
- Weather emoji icons for different conditions (clear, cloud, rain, snow, storm, etc.)
- Files created: web/components/HourlyForecast.tsx
- Modified: web/app/page.tsx to import and include HourlyForecast component
- TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Horizontal scroll containers can be styled with Tailwind's overflow-x-auto
  - Scrollbar hiding via CSS using scrollbar-hide class with webkit-scrollbar
  - Current hour detection uses Date.getHours() comparison
  - Button states managed with conditional className rendering for visual feedback
  - Detailed info shows only when an hour is selected, using state management
  - Time formatting uses 12-hour format with AM/PM indicator
  - Grid layout for detailed info uses grid-cols-3 to display 3 key metrics
